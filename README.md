# slides_template

Opinionated template for slides in [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com), with the markdown, code highlight, speaker notes and [tldreveal](https://github.com/arthurrump/tldreveal) drawing plugins enabled. It also includes some theming tweaks and default configurations.

Requirements: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). The repo includes a [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) lock file, but feel free to just use npm if you prefer to keep many copies of your npm packages on disk.

- Run `pnpm install` or `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `pnpm serve` or `npm run serve` to start a server with live reloading
- Run `pnpm build` or `npm run build` to package your slides in the *dist* folder
